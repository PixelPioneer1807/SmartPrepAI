## üåü Project Overview

SmartPrepAI is a production-ready, AI-powered study platform that has evolved beyond simple question generation. It now implements a sophisticated **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline, creating a deeply personalized and adaptive learning experience. The application is built with a modern, cloud-native architecture and includes SaaS-ready features like a one-time free trial for its premium capabilities.

### üéØ Key Innovation: Personalized Prep with RAG
Unlike basic quiz generators, SmartPrepAI's core innovation is its **Personalized Prep** system:
- **Learns from Mistakes:** When a user fails to meet their personally set pass score, the application saves the questions they got wrong into a dedicated **vector database**.
- **Contextual Retrieval:** For a personalized session, it retrieves the user's specific past mistakes related to a topic.
- **Targeted Generation (RAG):** The AI uses the retrieved mistakes as context to generate a brand-new, targeted quiz designed to address the user's unique weak points.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Secure JWT Authentication:** Stateful, secure user registration and login using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Standard Quiz Generation:** Create unlimited quizzes on a wide range of technical subjects with varying difficulty levels.
- **Enhanced Analytics Dashboard:** An interactive dashboard with visualizations tracking performance over time and average scores by topic.
- **Custom Pass Score:** Users can set their own personal goal for what constitutes a "passing" score.
- **Performance Alerts:** A proactive alert system that analyzes a user's last 10 questions and suggests a focused quiz if it detects a drop in performance.
- **üöÄ Personalized Prep (Premium RAG Feature):**
  - Automatically saves the context of incorrectly answered questions to a user-specific FAISS vector store.
  - Generates highly targeted review quizzes based on this stored context.
  - **SaaS-Ready:** Includes a **one-time free trial** for this premium feature, with logic to disable it after use, paving the way for a subscription model.
